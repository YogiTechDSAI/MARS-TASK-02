#2.Components used and steps in doing this project:- 
Components used:- Ultrasonic sensors,Arduino UNO,MD10C Motor Driver,DC Motor,Wires,Battery. Steps:- 
1.Firstly I have collected all the required components and assembled them at one place. 
2.I have connected arduino with MD10C motor driver and write a code for it in the Arduino IDE 
3.I have checked it's working by connecting it to battery.
4.The DIR pin of Motor Driver is connected to PIN2 of Arduino and PWM pin is connected to PIN3 of arduino and Ground to Ground connection.
5.Then I integrate the connections of Ultrasonic sensors with Arduino .I connected Echo and Trigger Pin of Ultrasonic Sensor to PIN12 and PIN13 of Arduino.Similarly I connected Vin to 5V Pin of Arduino and Ground to Ground Connection.
6.Then I joined the power port of motor driver to a battery and write the code for various cases.
7.Initially there was a bit problem in code then i checked again and correct my mistakes. 
8.At last, the Motor starts rotating whenever the ultrasonic sensor detect any movement.
